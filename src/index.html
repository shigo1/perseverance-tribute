    <ul>
     
       <li>
         <h5> Pre launch Activities July 2020</h5>
         <p>	Preparation for the mission, including pre-project planning, science definition and instrument selection, landing site selection, assembly and testing, and delivery to Cape Canaveral </p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h5> Launch  July 30, 2020</h5>
         <p>	Lift-off from Earth at 4:50 a.m. PDT (7:50 a.m. EDT).

      <li>
         <h5> Cruise</h5>
         <p>	The cruise phase begins after the spacecraft separates from the rocket, soon after launch. The spacecraft departs Earth at a speed of about 24,600 mph (about 39,600 kph). </p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h5> Approach, Entry and Decent February 18, 2021 </h5>

       </li>
       <li>
         <h5> Instrument Checks and First Drive</h5>
         <p> After landing when engineers first conduct tests to ensure the rover is in a "safe state"</p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <h5> Surface Operations</h5>
         <p> The surface operations phase is the time when the Perseverance rover conducts its scientific studies on Mars.The rover has a primary mission span of at least one Martian year (687 Earth days).</p>
